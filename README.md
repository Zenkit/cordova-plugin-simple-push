# cordova-plugin-simple-push

> Register and receive push notifications

## Overview

This plugin is a simplified version of the great [`phonegap-plugin-push`](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-push) plugin.
It is limited to `Android` and `iOS` and also removed the `FCM` support for `Ã¬OS` to remove the `CocoaPods` dependency.

Install with Cordova CLI:

```sh
cordova plugin add https://github.com/zenkit/cordova-plugin-simple-push#v3.0.1
```
